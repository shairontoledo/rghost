== Changed in this fork
Added an option to set the file-in external encoding to resolve some encoding issues with Ruby 1.9

===RGhost::Config::GS[:external_encoding]
This affects how data will be written and could help when dealing with encoding conversion errors
like UndefinedConversionError ... from ASCII-8BIT to UTF-8.
  RGhost::Config::GS[:external_encoding]= 'ascii-8bit'
Default: nil
